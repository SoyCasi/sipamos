sipamos
=======

Simple python script that makes a call, plays a wave and disconnects using pjsip pythion lib

Just edit sipamos.py to change your sip account settings and the destination number and run the script.

It will call the destination defined on dst_uri, play the file message.wav when the call is answered by the destination and hangup in the end.

The configurations presented are the ones i use for my ISP sip account (vodafone.pt)
